# Weapon Detection System

Welcome to the Weapon Detection System project! This repository implements an object detection-based weapon alert system for detecting knives and guns, accessible via a web interface.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust weapon detection system utilizing advanced object detection algorithms. By leveraging both the SSD V2 and YOLO V3 architectures, the system achieves high accuracy in detecting weapons, ensuring safety and security in various environments.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detects knives and guns using state-of-the-art models (SSD V2 and YOLO V3).
- **Web Interface**: Accessible through a user-friendly web application built with Flask.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves an accuracy of 96.2% for weapon detection.
- **Fast Inference Speed**: Processes video frames at 45 FPS without compromising accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- OpenCV
- YOLO V3 (You Only Look Once)
- SSD V2 (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VedantDhamale/Weapon_Detection_System.git

2. To run the weapon detection system, start the Flask application::
   ```bash
   python main.py
